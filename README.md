## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate AI student with a strong foundation in programming, machine learning, and full-stack development. I love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems — from recommender systems and chatbots to Android apps and data pipelines.

As a Junior Project Manager at Array House, I’ve led development of scalable apps using agile methodologies. I enjoy bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions.
